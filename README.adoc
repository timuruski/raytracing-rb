= Raytracing in one Weekend in Ruby

The plan is to work through this ray tracing exercise using Ruby. The guide suggests using C++
for this, but I'm curious if Ruby is up to the task. I expect the renderer will be quite slow,
but since it only needs to grind out a single image, it should be tolerable.
